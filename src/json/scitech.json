DSC, IIT Bhilai was set-up primarily to ensure that we can bridge the divide between a student’s eagerness to learn and the technology evolving every day. The DSC program is a grass root channel through which the members of the community provide development skills for students towards employability. In addition to workshops, DSCs also provide an opportunity for students to apply their newly gained skills to develop solutions for local organizations and then provide visibility via showcases. DSC IIT Bhilai is one stop point for any software vertical at IIT Bhilai. The areas that we cover are Competitive Programming, Machine Learning, Cloud Development, Web Development and App Development. We have got a dedicated team of core members working for every area.",
