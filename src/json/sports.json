As part of our educational syllabus we are expected to learn about a number ofsubjects, however, one of particular interest to us is physical education and sports, as they have amassive part to play within the education system. Sports teach us key values such as: Teamwork, Respect,Passion, Hard work and many other key attributes that help towards developing an individual’s character.Presence of good sports facilities is a vital tool in developing the above skills. The following sectionselaborate on the sports facilities present at IIT Bhilai which will help the students to tackle thechallenging curriculum with renewed vigour.
