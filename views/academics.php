IIT Bhilai follows semester system and allows the students to do many basic courses in different departments and specialised courses in greater depth.</p>
                    <p class="intro__text">Every course at IIT Bhilai generally runs for the entire semester (~ 14 weeks in case of a regular semester). A student registers for the courses that he/she wants to study and at the end of the semester a grade is awarded. On obtaining a pass grade, the student earns all the credits associated with the course while a fail grade does not get any credit.</p>
                    <p class="intro__text">Each course has a certain number of credit(s) or non-graded unit(s) assigned to it depending upon the L-T-P structure of the course. </p>

                    <p class="fractal__text">Before we dive right into the departmental subjects offered lets first talk about the common subjects that are taught to all the streams. Since you will be studying in the Fractal system, a drastically different system compared to the existing systems in place at the other IIT’s which follow mostly the traditional system; you will be introduced to the core subjects from the very first semester. The common subjects that we study are slightly different from what is taught elsewhere and is slightly more industry inclined. With that we begin the list of subjects.</p>

                        <h3 class="heading-tertiary"><i class="far fa-dot-circle"></i> What is Fractal System?</h3>
                        <p class="info__text">IIT Bhilai has adopted a very innovative academic structure (courtesy IIT Hyderabad), referred to as Fractal Academics which is the first step in creating an experiential learning ambience.</p>
                        <ul class="info__list">
                            <li class="info__item">At the centre of Fractal Academics is the concept of <strong>T-education</strong> &mdash; Breadth and Depth.</li>
                            <li class="info__item">Under ‘T’ education, we have classified the courses that require width and length for training separately.</li>
                            <li class="info__item">Subsequently, each subject is fractalised (divided) into various segments with 1 or 2 credits.</li>
                            <li class="info__item">Breadth courses are basic building block for the depth courses.</li>
                            <li class="info__item">The fundamental idea is to atomize the credits to enable the students to get breadth in a large number of courses and depth in the courses of your choice.</li>
                            <li class="info__item">Initial emphasis is on breadth courses (first four semesters) and then on depth.</li>
                            <li class="info__item">Breadth courses are typically of 1 credit. There are plenty of such courses to help build a broad perspective. Introductory core courses provide students a window into further important topics.</li>
                            <li class="info__item">Depth courses are built on the foundation set by the breadth courses and are of 2 credits or more. For e.g., courses in the first semester are intended to provide a glimpse of all the core areas in EE viz., control systems, communication and signal processing, microelectronics and power electronics.</li>
                            <li class="info__item">In-depth coverage of core topics is offered in the depth courses.</li>
                            <li class="info__item">Often students build products/prototypes – bridging gulf between theory and practice.</li>
                            <li class="info__item">A balance is sought between technical and non-technical courses to reduce stress in students.</li>
                            <li class="info__item">There are numerous liberal arts/creative arts courses too depending upon student’s choice. (These include 1 credit courses related to Economics, Arts, Performing Arts, Management etc.)</li>

                            <li class="info__item">Students get exposure to basic tools early. Here: MatLab, SolidEdge, GNU Octave, Arduino Genuino and many more.</li>

                            <li class="info__item">The design of the system itself reduces the course burden, hence giving you ample amount of time to explore the topic.</li>

                            <li class="info__item">Many courses will be hands on (significant duration of course will be in labs or on computers), hence there will be ample opportunities to pick up practical skills which actually matter in the industry.</li>
                            <li class="info__item">The flexibility of courses will also give you more than enough time to pursue some non-academic interests also like music, sports, arts etc. We recommend you all to pick up at least one of them. After all, "Break toh banta hai Boss"</li>
                            <li class="info__item">A balance is sought between technical and non-technical courses to reduce stress in students.</li>
                            <li class="info__item"> With increased flexibility, creeps in lethargy. It is always better to be alert and spend some time with each subject taught to avoid unwanted outcomes. (You know what we mean :&dash;P )</li>
