DSC, IIT Bhilai was set-up primarily to ensure that we can bridge the divide between a student’s eagerness to learn and the technology evolving every day. The DSC program is a grass root channel through which the members of the community provide development skills for students towards employability. In addition to workshops, DSCs also provide an opportunity for students to apply their newly gained skills to develop solutions for local organizations and then provide visibility via showcases. DSC IIT Bhilai is one stop point for any software vertical at IIT Bhilai. The areas that we cover are Competitive Programming, Machine Learning, Cloud Development, Web Development and App Development. We have got a dedicated team of core members working for every area. </p>

A lot of students of our institute are interested in learning blockchain technology, but due to lack of guidance, they end up giving up on learning blockchain and find some other interests. This society will prevent exactly this; we will be guiding students who are interested in learning blockchain, we will cover both, theoretical and practical aspects and make sure that they stand on their own feet. We will teach blockchain, work on blockchain-related projects, conduct hackathons, invite high profile speakers from the industry, and build good relationships with the leading blockchain companies.</p><br>

The primary mandate of MIC is to encourage, inspire and nurture young students by supporting them to work with new ideas and transform them into prototypes while they are informative years.
                    MIC has envisioned encouraging creation of ‘Institution’s Innovation Council (IICs)’ across selected HEIs. A network of these IICs has been established to promote innovation in the Institution through multitudinous modes leading to an innovation promotion eco-system in the campuses.
